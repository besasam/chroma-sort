# Chroma Sort
A simple color sorting browser game.

Current version: **0.1.2**

## Demo
You can play it on [my website](https://besasam.github.io/demos/chroma-sort/). (version might not be up to date)

## How to play
Drag & drop the boxes into the correct order to make a gradient between two colors. Change the difficulty using the buttons below and see how many points you can collect.

The outer colors are chosen randomly. If they are too similar, simply click the buttons again to get a new level - don't worry, you won't lose your points until you reload the page.

## Development
Planned fixes and features can be found in the issue tracker. You are welcome to add your own suggestions, or even work on the code yourself and start a pull request! 100% of pull requests for this project so far have been accepted ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
