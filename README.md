# Chroma Sort
Simple color sorting game written in JavaScript, using jQuery, [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/) and [Buzz](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/).

## How to play
Open index.html in your browser. The game is initialized with 5 squares but you can set your own number in the input box, higher number of squares = higher difficulty. Simply drag & drop the squares in the correct order & see how many points you can collect! :)
