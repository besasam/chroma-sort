# Chroma Sort
Simple color sorting game written in JavaScript, using jQuery, [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/) and [Buzz](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/).

## How to play
Open index.html in your browser. The game is initialized with 5 squares but you can set your own number in the input box, higher number of squares = higher difficulty. Once you sort the squares correctly, a success message is logged in the console and you can start a new game.
